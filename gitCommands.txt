git init - to initialise a repo 

git config user.name PranavPhanindra
git config user.email pranavnag257@gmail.com

Can declare even for global case also

git config --global user.name PranavPhanindra
git config --global user.email pranavnag257@gmail.com

git add . # Adds all the elements into the stage where we can commit later
git add <fileName> #Incase of a specific file at hand

git log #Tells about all the commits that have happened till now
git status # Status of each file whether added or committed in the repo where git was initialised

git commit -m <"message"> #Commit all the changes made in the repo by a commit message

Always it requires to have an initial commit before creating a branch
git brach <branchName>
git branch -[options] branchName - To be explored
git branch -m <NewName>

Deleting a branch when we are on the branch would give us error regarding the file.
So we need to change the branch and then delete
