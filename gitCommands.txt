git init - to initialise a repo 

git config user.name PranavPhanindra
git config user.email pranavnag257@gmail.com

Can declare even for global case also

git config --global user.name PranavPhanindra
git config --global user.email pranavnag257@gmail.com

git add . # Adds all the elements into the stage where we can commit later
git add <fileName> #Incase of a specific file at hand

git log #Tells about all the commits that have happened till now
git status # Status of each file whether added or committed in the repo where git was initialised

git commit -m <"message"> #Commit all the changes made in the repo by a commit message

Always it requires to have an initial commit before creating a branch
git brach <branchName>
git branch -[options] branchName - To be explored
git branch -m <NewName>

Deleting a branch when we are on the branch would give us error regarding the file.
So we need to change the branch and then delete

git merge <branchName> - merges the branch we are in and the branch we have given as argument

Here we have the merging which can result in generating merge conflicts so we can abort the merge or we can resolve the conflict and continue to do the same
git merge --abort #Aborts the merge process

git log [options] #To be explored
git log --all --graph --oneline - makes a graph of all the commits and the commits are listed in oneline 

We cannot change the branch once we are on a branch and we have made changes and we havent committed
So we would want to stash them so that we can come back and work on the files that we are editing
(base) dmacs@suvam:~/testGit$ git switch master
error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:
        gitCommands.txt
Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
Aborting

Stashing

git stash 
git stash pop 
git stash apply
git stash list  
git stash drop <stashName>
git stash clear
